# NewTorrent
NewTorrent is the easiest way to search and stream torrents. Tell it what you want to watch, the app will search multiple different sources. Video from the Internet Archive, music from Creative Commons, or audiobooks from Librivox, play it right away with the built in Video Player. 

We use search engines and TMDB to find relevant images and metadata about the content you are searching to help display and organise your torrents in a simple, easy to view, interface. 

You can watch on your device, Screenshare or Cast to your TV via Chromecast. 

The best part is, once you have viewed the content, the app will automatically share the file with one other person, then it will be deleted for you; so you don't have to manage storage space on your device. 

You may also use the integrated search to download other types of torrent, e.g. Software. 



Downloading copyrighted content is not endorsed or encouraged by NewTorrent. We provide a neutral search engine for the user to search their own content. NewTorrent is not responsible for the content you download using it.


With special thanks to the following services to which this project is built upon:
	• VLC Media Player for the video player module
	• LibreTorrent for providing the torrent engine
	• TMDB for providing data scraping
	• Bing Search for providing image data
